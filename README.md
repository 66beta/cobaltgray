### How to Install

You can also install the theme manually:

2. Unzip and rename the folder to `Theme - Cobaltgray`
3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...`

### How to Activate

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>,</kbd> on Mac).

You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both* color scheme and UI theme so they match.

#### Settings

```json
{
  "theme": "Cobaltgray.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Cobaltgray/cobaltgray.tmTheme"
}
```
***Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.***
